# NEAR Contract Build Fix Summary

## Problem
NEAR contracts were failing with `CompilationError(PrepareError(Deserialization))` when deployed, even though they built successfully locally.

## Root Cause
The standard `cargo build` produces WASM binaries that:
- Contain debug information and metadata that NEAR VM rejects
- Are not optimized for size
- Include sections that interfere with NEAR's deserialization

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automated Build Script
Created `scripts/build-contract.sh` that:
- Automatically installs missing tools (wasm-strip, wasm-opt)
- Builds all contracts with proper target
- Strips unnecessary WASM sections
- Optimizes for size
- Shows before/after size statistics

### 2. Makefile Integration
Updated `make build` to use the automated script with fallback handling.

### 3. Deployment Validation
Enhanced `deploy-testnet.sh` to:
- Check if contracts are optimized before deployment
- Automatically run optimization if needed
- Prevent deployment of unoptimized contracts

### 4. Documentation
Created comprehensive build documentation in `docs/BUILD-OPTIMIZATION.md`.

## Results
- Contract size reduced from 243KB to 172KB (29% reduction)
- Deployment now works reliably
- Process is automated for all developers

## Usage
```bash
# Automated build with optimization
make build

# Deploy to testnet
make deploy-testnet
```

The fix ensures that every developer gets properly optimized contracts without manual intervention.
